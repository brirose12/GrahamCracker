<h2>My School</h2>

<br/>
I came to the University of New Haven as a freshman and started studying Forensic Psychology. I then changed my major to Criminal Justice with a concentration in Investigative Services and am currently pursuing a certificate in Victim Service Administration. I am currently involved in a few clubs and a dance team. Being involved in so much has given me the opportunity to meet so many different people and lifelong friends.College has certainly cracked me out of my shell and got me to try new things.

<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

By living at school I get the freedom to do things on my own and explore new places. While living at school I like having the opportunity to hangout with whoever I want and the convenience  of all my friends being relatively close. For fun I usually will take mall trips with my friends or go out to eat. I also like to workout, its kind of like a stress reliever. Sometimes I miss being home with my family but the freedom I have gives me the opportunity to explores myself and grow as an individual.
